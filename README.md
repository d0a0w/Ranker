# Ranker
Python script that takes in a list of things from a txt file, compares 2 items at a time (asking the user for their preference), and prints their personal ranking of the items on the list.

To use, put each thing you want to rank in unRanked.txt, each item on its own line.
Keep the last line as "buffer" for whatever reason, it won't read the last line.
